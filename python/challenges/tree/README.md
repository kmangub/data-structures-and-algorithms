## Queue with Stacks
Write an instance method called `find-maximum-value`. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Challenge
- Function returns the largest value in the Binary Tree

## Approach & Efficiency
We need to make sure that code challenge 15 has a Binary Tree implementation, which is a prerequisite for completing this code challenge.
