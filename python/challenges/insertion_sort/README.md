## Insertion Sort
- Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code
- Convert the pseudo-code into working code in your language
- Present a complete set of working tests

## Challenge
- Function returns sorted list with insertion_sort.

## Approach & Efficiency
I've seen a lot of examples and explanations on how the code works, but there are some gaps that I need to fill. I used youtube to help me close those gaps and I was able to explain my thought process through the blog.
