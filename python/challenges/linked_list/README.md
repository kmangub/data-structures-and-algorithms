## Linked List
We are to create a linked list using a node class and a LinkedList class. The LinkList contains an insert method, which inserts a node with any argument given, including strings. Additionally, the LinkedList class includes an includes method that takes in a value as an argument and goes through the linked list by traversing. Lastly, the string method takes our collection of nodes and brings into a string form. 

## Challenge
1. Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
1. Can properly insert into the linked list
1. The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
1. Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
1. Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
1. Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
1. Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list

## Approach & Efficiency
The Linked List reading prior to class was a good resource to use. We also used google to help us out with plenty of examples.
